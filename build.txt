TO BUILD THE PROJECT WE'VE USED pyinstaller with the following command:
pyinstaller --onefile CVIP.py

After that pyinstaller will create CVIP.spec, build directory and dist directory.
Executable file of CVIP will be placed in /dist.
You can test the tool with the following prompt:
./CVIP [-i=input.png]face_blur:30[-o=out]
